# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

Understanding credit risk is vital for lenders. As lending demand continue to grow, so will lender expectations in risk prediction. This technical analysis is focused on evaluating several machine learning models to predict credit risk. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
